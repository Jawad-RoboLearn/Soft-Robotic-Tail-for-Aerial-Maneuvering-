# Soft Robotic Tail for Aerial Maneuvering
Terrestrial robots use their tails to do agile maneuvers in the air i.e. self-righting, flipping, jump, etc. Motivated by this, we have developed a mathematical model of so-called terrestrial robot with rigid body (trunk), soft robotic tail, and actuators.

Codes and theoratical understanding will be uploaded after the acceptance of research paper, which is currently submitted in IEEE, International Conference on Advanced Robotics.
