# Soft-Robotic-Tail-for-Aerial-Maneuvering-
Terrestrial robots use their tails to do agile maneuvers in the air i.e. self-righting, flipping, jump, etc. Motivated by this, we have developed a mathematical model of so-called terrestrial robot with rigid body (trunk), soft robotic tail, and actuators.
